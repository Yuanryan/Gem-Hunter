4. If no shield, player plays hurt animation
5. After damage, white gem healing is applied

#### Death Prevention

- **No Goal Loss in Combat**: Completing goals doesn't trigger defeat

## üéØ Tips for Success

5. **Shield Timing**: Build shields before enemy attacks
6. **Healing Strategy**: Use white gems when low on health
7. **Objective Priority**: Complete objectives to unlock enemy defeat
